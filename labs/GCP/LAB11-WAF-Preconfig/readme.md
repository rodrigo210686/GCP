## Cloud Armor Preconfigured WAF Rules

Google Cloud Armor is Google's enterprise edge network security solution providing DDOS protection, WAF rule enforcement, and adaptive manageability at scale.

Cloud Armor has extended the preconfigured WAF rule sets to mitigate against the (OWASP Top 10)[https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/] web application security vulnerabilities. The rule sets are based on the OWASP Modsecurity core rule set version 3.0.2 to protect against some of the most common web application security risks including local file inclusion (lfi), remote file inclusion (rfi), remote code execution (rce), and many more.

In this lab, you learn how to mitigate some of the common vulnerabilities by using Google Cloud Armor WAF rules.
