Google Cloud Armor Edge Security Policies allow you to restrict access to cached objects on Google Cloud CDN and Google Cloud Storage. Examples of reasons to do this include ensuring that your users do not access objects in storage buckets from restricted geographies or ensuring that your media distribution is filtering on the geographies that you have a license to do so.

In this lab you create a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, upload an image to it, bind it to a load balancer and then enable Cloud CDN and Edge Security policies on it.
